# FieldtypeKeyValueMultiple (ALPHA)
**Please know that this fieldtype is considered alpha and missing important features**

Note that the code is still quiet messy. Cleanup will be done once it's out of alpha. And more documentation will follow, too.

**This module is derived from [FieldtypeEvents](https://github.com/ryancramerdesign/FieldtypeEvents)**

Its purpose is to provide kind of a basic two column table, with customizable column names to have it shareable between different templates for different purposes.


## Install

1. Copy the files for this module to /site/modules/FieldtypeKeyValueMultiple/ 
2. In admin: Modules > Check for new modules. Install Fieldtype > KeyValueMultiple.
3. Create a new field of type KeyValueMultiple, and name it whatever you would 
   like. In our examples we named it simply "keyValues". 
4. Add the field to a template and edit a page using that template. 

## Missing
* rows are not yet deletable
